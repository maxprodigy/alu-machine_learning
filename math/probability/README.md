# Probability

Probability theory is a mathematical framework for quantifying our uncertainty about the world. It allows us (and our software) to reason effectively in situations where being certain is impossible. Probability theory is at the foundation of many machine learning algorithms. 

 Alternatively, the subjectivist viewpoint is that probabilities represent our degree of belief that an event will occur. Whatever our beliefs of the true nature of randomness, we need some principled methods for actually estimating probabilities.
